			<h1>Cairn Climbing App</h1>
			<h2>2018, React Native / Ruby on Rails / GraphQL / Design & UX</h2>
			<p>Together with my colleagues at Moonbase, we developed a mobile application for climbers and boulderers. This application allowed users to log their climbing sessions, see which routes they climbed and how long they climbed.   Cairn Climbing provided users with analytics, giving insights in their climbing skill and progression. It also featured a social feed where they could follow other climbers, see their friends’ climbing activity, and participate in social competitions.
			<p>  I worked on the Ruby back-end, React Native app, the GraphQL API, as well as the design and UX.</p>

			<h1>Scale</h1>
			<h2>Design / Swift / Bluetooth Low Energy</h2>
			<p>A small utility application that connects to your smart bluetooth scale. It will show the measurements made by the scale, without requiring any account or saving and sharing any data. It supports saving all measurements to Apple Health.</p>
			<p>I initially wrote this application for private use because I didn't like that the official Medisana app requires you to store all your personal data on their servers.</p>

			<h1>Spine</h1>
			<h2>2014 - 2018, Swift</h2>
			<p>Spine is a Swift library for working with APIs that adhere to the <a href="https://jsonapi.org">jsonapi.org</a> standard. It supports mapping to custom model classes, fetching, advanced querying, linking and persisting.</p>
			<p>After contributing to the <a href="https://jsonapi.org">JSON:API</a> project, I built a Swift client library that interfaces with JSON:API Apis. Although I do not use and maintain this library anymore, it is still maintained by a small community on GitHub.</p>
