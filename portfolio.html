				<p>Eypo is a mobile application that provide users with insights in their monthly expenses. It connects to your bank, downloads all recent transactions and categorizes them using a learning classification algorithm.</p>
				<p>  For this application I currently develop both the back-end and front-end, as well as all the mobile and web design.   Eypo is currently in beta testing for users of Bunq bank.</p>

				<h1>Cairn Climbing app</h1>
				<h2>2018, React Native / Ruby on Rails / GraphQL</h2>
				<p>Together with my colleagues at Moonbase, we developed a mobile application for climbers and boulderers. This application allowed users to log their climbing sessions, see which routes they climbed and how long they climbed.   Cairn Climbing provided users with analytics, giving insights in their climbing skill and progression. It also featured a social feed where they could follow other climbers, see their friends’ climbing activity, and participate in social competitions.
				<p>  I mainly worked on the back-end in Ruby on Rails, the front-end in React Native, and a GraphQL API to connect them.</p>

				<h1>Spine</h1>
				<h2>2014 - 2018, Swift</h2>
				<p>Spine is a Swift library for working with APIs that adhere to the <a href="https://jsonapi.org">jsonapi.org</a> standard. It supports mapping to custom model classes, fetching, advanced querying, linking and persisting.</p>
				<p>After contributing to the <a href="https://jsonapi.org">JSON:API</a> project, I built a Swift client library that interfaces with JSON:API Apis. Although I do not use and maintain this library anymore, it is still maintained by a small community on GitHub.</p>

				<h1>Popapeek</h1>
				<h2>2014 - 2016, Swift / Objective-C / Ember.js / JSON:API / Ruby on Rails / AWS</h2>
				<p>Popapeek is a platform where hotel guests can leave video reviews, offering a better alternative to written reviews, and bringing customers and brands closer together.</p>
				<p>I worked on UX and development of the iOS app in Swift and Obj-C, the admin-panel in Ember.js, and a Ruby back-end that contained a REST API and a full video transcoding system. I also managed sysops, working with Heroku and Amazon Web Services.</p>
